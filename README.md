# Cybersecurity-Awareness-Tool
My bachelor's thesis project. This project is inspired by CyGraph developed in the MITRE corporation. "CyGraph is a system for improving network   security posture, maintaining situational awareness in the face of cyberattacks, and focusing on protection of mission-critical assets [1]." My 
main objective was to integrate with Splunk in order to capture real-time data and to improve the graphical representation of the nodes and their relations. The code is not supposed to be runnable.
